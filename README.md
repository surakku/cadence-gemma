# CadenceGemma

CadenceGemma is a semi-novel multimodal architecure built upon [RecurrentGemma](https://github.com/google-deepmind/recurrentgemma). RecurrentGemma makes use of the novel [Griffin architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427), consisting of a hybrid state-space making use of local attention and linear recurrances.

Cadence builds upon RecurrentGemma in a way similar to [Cobra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14520) with Mamba, by introducing a combined vision encoder and projector in order to combine modalities in a shared semantic space. RecurrentGemma is then fine tuned to interperet the projected visual tokens.

Disclaimer - This is ongoing research and is still progressing. Torch implementation works, however quite slow. Working on jax implementation at the moment.

### Learn more about RecurrentGemma

-   The [RecurrentGemma technical report](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemma/recurrentgemma-report.pdf) gives specific details on the training and evaluation of RecurrentGemma.
-   The [Griffin paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427) describes the underlying model architecture.

## Quick start

### Installation

#### Using Poetry
RecurrentGemma uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependency
management.

To install dependencies for the full project:
* Checkout the code.
* `poetry install -E full` to create a virtual environment with all dependencies.
* `poetry shell` to activate the created virtual environment.

If you only need to install a subset of dependencies use one of the alternative
library-specific commands below.

#### Using pip
If you want to use `pip` instead of Poetry, 
then create a virtual environment (run `python -m venv recurrentgemma-demo` and `. recurrentgemma-demo/bin/activate`) and:

* Checkout the code.
* `pip install .[full]`

#### Installing library-specific packages

##### JAX
To install dependencies only for the JAX pathway use:
`poetry install -E jax` or (`pip install .[jax]`).

##### PyTorch
To install dependencies only for the PyTorch pathway use:
`poetry install -E torch` (or `pip install .[torch]`).

##### Tests
To install dependencies required for running unit tests use:
`poetry install -E test` (or `pip install .[test]`)

### Downloading the models

The model checkpoints are available through Kaggle at
http://kaggle.com/models/google/recurrentgemma.
Select either the **Flax** or **PyTorch** model variations, click the ⤓ button
to download the model archive, then extract the contents to a local directory.

In both cases, the archive contains both the model weights and
the tokenizer.

### Running the unit tests

To run the tests, install the optional `[test]` dependencies (e.g. using `pip install .[test]`) from the root of the source tree, then:

```
pytest .
```

## Examples

To run the example sampling script, pass the paths to the weights directory and tokenizer:

```
python examples/sampling_jax.py \
  --path_checkpoint=/path/to/archive/contents/2b/ \
  --path_tokenizer=/path/to/archive/contents/tokenizer.model
```

### Colab notebook tutorials

-   [`colabs/sampling_tutorial_jax.ipynb`](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/google-deepmind/recurrentgemma/blob/main/colabs/sampling_tutorial_jax.ipynb)
    contains a [Colab](http://colab.google) notebook with a sampling example using JAX.

-   [`colabs/sampling_tutorial_pytorch.ipynb`](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/google-deepmind/recurrentgemma/blob/main/colabs/sampling_tutorial_pytorch.ipynb)
    contains a [Colab](http://colab.google) notebook with a sampling example using PyTorch.

-   [`colabs/fine_tuning_tutorial_jax.ipynb`](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/google-deepmind/recurrentgemma/blob/main/colabs/fine_tuning_tutorial_jax.ipynb)
    contains a [Colab](http://colab.google) with a basic tutorial on how to
    fine-tune RecurrentGemma for a task, such as English to French translation, using JAX.

To run these notebooks you will need to have a Kaggle account and first read and accept
the Gemma license terms and conditions from the [RecurrentGemma page](http://kaggle.com/models/google/recurrentgemma).
After this you can run the notebooks, which will automatically download the weights and tokenizer from there.

Currently different notebooks are supported under the following hardware:

| Hardware            | T4  | P100 | V100 | A100 | TPUv2 | TPUv3+ |
|---------------------|:---:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|:------:|
| Sampling in Jax     | ✅  | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅    | ✅    |
| Sampling in PyTorch | ✅  | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅    | ✅    |
| Finetuning in Jax   | ✅  | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ❌    | ✅    |


## System Requirements

RecurrentGemma code can run on CPU, GPU or TPU.
The code has been optimized for running on TPU using the Flax implementation,
which contains a low level [Pallas](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pallas/index.html) kernel to perform the linear scan in the recurrent layers.
